# Tesserium

Τέσσερα, or tessera, is 4 in greek. The group consists of 4 middle-schoolers who are interested in the bare bones of the informatic science, unix, programming, git and Minecraft.
Our model is the [Haxx](https://haxx.se/) group: four interactive and friendly men, working on a famous and useful program, and not stopping at anything to achieve goals.

Pssst! Wondering about our nationality? We're Chinese, not Greek! The reason why we choose tέσσερα instead of 四 is pretty obvious: if we use si, then people will think that we're trying to say yes in Spanish; and if we use 四, git is going to complain that it does not understand this character.

### So... I don't think anyone else can see this so it'll just be like this for now.
