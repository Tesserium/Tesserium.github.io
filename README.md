# Tesserium

Τέσσερα, or tessera, is 4 in modern greek. The group consists of 4 middle-schoolers who are interested in the bare bones of the informatic science, unix, programming, git and Minecraft.
Our model is the [Haxx](https://haxx.se/) group: four interacitve and friendly men, working on a famous and useful program, and not stopping at anything to achieve our goals.
